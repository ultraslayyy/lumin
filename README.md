# Swift

I picked the name because it sounded cool ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I'm making this to improve my knowledge. In no way is this better than Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera/OperaGX, Safari, or any other decent browser out there, sicne they use Chromium with Blink, which is very fast. I'm doing this from scratch because I want to learn how to do it.

(This version is on hold. I am currently working in the `Electron` branch to use as a base for everything)

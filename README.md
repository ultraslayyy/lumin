# Swift

I picked the name because it sounded cool ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I'm making this to improve my knowledge. In no way is this better than Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera/OperaGX, Safari, or any other decent browser out there, since they use Chromium with Blink, which is very fast. I'm doing this from scratch because I want to learn how to do it.

**Note:** I am using dotnet and WebView2 currently with WinForms, but this may change soon

# Swift
Swift is a browser with a focus on speed and efficiency. It focuses on decluttering, only including the essentials, with other features like extensions disabled by default (there is a chrome extension support Swift extension. More on that later). For this reason, some features, like the aforementioned extensions disabled by default for speed reasons, a button for them not even visible until one is installed.

## Speed
Swift is focused entirely on speed. Not the actual loading of the webpages, but each and every individual interaction being optimised to be as fast as I can make it (without learning Vulkan that is). I have no idea how fast I will be able to make this browser yet, but I will try to make it as fast as I possibly can.

## Extensions
Swift has it's own extension API, and does not use Google's, therefore chrome extensions do not work. We are working on supporting chrome extensions, but for now they are not supported (to support them I'd have to create an interpreter to interpret chrome extensions' code to work with Swift, which will come in future when I find time for it.)
